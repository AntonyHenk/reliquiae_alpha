# reliquiae_alpha
Storage for everything related to my relic list edition tool building, including small python scripts and tools.
If you are curious about this project, please view my neocities site: https://locasanctorum.neocities.org/ 
I will be uploading more documentation and other things on here as I go. 

/XML_relic_lists/ - XML transcriptions of relic lists

/XML_CSS/ - CSS for styling relic list xml files ONLY

/neocities_specific/ - CSS and HTML for Loca Sanctorum site (kept separate from the XML because Loca Sanctorum will later be superseded by    another cite, and because styling for list viewing and styling for the site are purposefully very different)

/beta_header_versions/ - a storage area for earlier versions of the XML with very simple teiHeaders

/scripts/ - place to hang onto bits and bobs of python and other tools for transcription/batch editing
