    <p><b>Please note! This page is continually updated and is still under construction.</b></p>

    <p>Below you can find links to some alpha versions of the web editions, which were based on prior print editions. These versions were very early explorations into how the material should be encoded and lack fully detailed markup. Editions are arranged in alphabetic order according to locale/monastic house. These web editions are based on <b>printed editions</b> of each text and thus do <b>not</b> directly encode manuscript data! Please be aware that this section is in development, and while the textual contents of all lists linked on this page are complete, some metadata may not be shown. For further bibliographical and manuscript metadata, be sure to see the <a href="reliclists.html" target="_blank">Relic List Catalogue</a>. Use the manuscript siglum (in the title in square brackets, also given as the first in the conspectus siglorum for each list) to locate the appropriate entry in the catalogue.</p>
