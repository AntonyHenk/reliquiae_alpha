    <br>
    <p>This is a slightly edited transcription of Bertram Colgrave's note on the correspondences between Trinity College Cambridge MS O. 3. 55 and Dijon, Bibliothéque publique, MS 657 (396). Bertram Colgrave and C. F. Battiscombe evidently corresponded over the topic of the relic lists, as there is a footnote in Battiscombe's edition in which he thanks Colgrave for sharing information about the Dijon MS. <!--Colgrave examined this manuscript and described it in his edition of...-->
      <br>
      I have only edited Colgrave's remarks insofar as I have expanded his shorthand and added punctuation where needed.  
    <h2>O. 3. 55     James III p. 241</h2>
    <p>1. List of relics formerly in Durham Priory      f. 2.
        This list occurs in almost identical form in MS Dijon 657 (early 13th cent.), f. 39v.
          'Caput Ceolwulfi' in 0. 3. 55 occurs as 'Caput Edwoldi' (evidently a slip) in Dijon 657.
          Also the last three items ('dens scī Potasii, Ossa Geronis confessoris, Ossa sanctarum virginum XI milium colonie') are missing in Dijon 657. Dijon 657 adds in the margin '[?]iculae digiti Sancti Wulstani' and 'Porachuim[?] sanctae lucie'. 
      2. Office of S. Cuthbert     f. 50.
      As in Dijon 657. Except that Dijon begins at '[?]ve presul gloriose', f. 51, and then proceeds to that part of the office which occurs as the beginning in 0. 3. 55, but the office is substantially the same.<br>
      The contents of the two manuscripts are apparently very similar as a whole but I only have photographs of a part of the Dijon MS. 
      <br><br>
      B. Colgrave  

<!--<h2>Manuscript</h2>
    <p>This relic list appears in several source manuscripts: <br>
      (1) It appears in Trinity College Cambridge MS O. 3. 55, f. 2r-v.<br> 
      (2) It appears in Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Digby 41, on the 'four leaves at the end of the manuscript', which are from an older MS (see below).<br> 
      (3) It appears in Dijon, Bibliothéque publique, MS 657 (396), f. 39r. <br> 
      Furthermore, this list is also 'bodily incorporated in the York list'[i.e., LocaSanctorumTextID: Y]. Additionally, an extract of this list was copied into Cambridge University Library Ff. I. 27 on f. 194v of the red chalk foliation [i.e., LocaSanctorumTextID: D1.A*].<br><br>

      According to N. R. Ker, the four leaves at the end of Digby 41 actually belong to a <em>Life of St Cuthbert</em>, British Library, MS Harley 1924.
      (Battiscombe, <em>Relics of St Cuthbert</em> (1956), 113; Ker, <em>British Museum Quarterly</em> 12(1938): 133.) 
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Dating</h2>
    <p>Battiscombe suggests that this list was written up after the translation of Cuthbert in 1104 to Durham, but not later than the middle of the twelfth century. His dating is derived from a combination of the list's relationship to its textual relatives (that is, Y and D1.A*)</p>
