    <h1>Durham, Cathedral Priory [D1]: Further Manuscript Context Notes</h1>
    <a class="navbutton" href="/reliclists.html">Return to Relic List Catalogue</a>
    <br>
    <h2>Manuscript</h2>
    <p>This relic list appears in several source manuscripts: <br>
      (1) It appears in Trinity College Cambridge MS O. 3. 55, f. 2r-v.<br> 
      (2) It appears in Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Digby 41, on the 'four leaves at the end of the manuscript' (ff. 91, 91*, 92, 101), which are from an older MS (see below).<br> 
      (3) It appears in Dijon, Bibliothéque municipale, MS 657 (396), f. 39r.<br> 
      Furthermore, this list is also 'bodily incorporated in the York list'[i.e., LocaSanctorumTextID: Y]. Additionally, an extract of this list was copied into Cambridge University Library Ff. I. 27 on f. 194v of the red chalk foliation [i.e., LocaSanctorumTextID: D1.A*].</p>
      <h3>Trinity College Cambridge MS O. 3. 55, f. 2r-v</h3>
      <p>(Details coming soon.)</p>
      <h3>Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Digby 41, ff. 91, 91*, 92, 101/British Library, MS Harley 1924</h3>
      <p>According to N. R. Ker, the four leaves at the end of Digby 41 (ff. 91, 91*, 92, 101) actually belong to a <i>Life of St Cuthbert</i>, British Library, MS Harley 1924. This latter manuscript is of Norman make and dates to the 2nd or 3rd quarter of saec. XII, and has early provenance at Durham.</p>
      <h3>Dijon, Bibliothéque municipale, MS 657 (396), f. 39r</h3>
      <p>The short catalogue entry for Dijon, Bib. Mun. MS 657 (369) on the Bibliothèque municipale de Dijon website refers to the list as a list of the relics of Lindisfarne, not Durham, and overall categorises this manuscript as collection of Lindisfarne-related saint's lives, mostly Bedan. This Lindisfarnian attribution to the relic list may simply be due to the cataloguer's unawareness of the details of the history of Lindisfarne, but this is not certain. The fact that this manuscript is of English make and dates to the first quarter of saec. XIII, well after the translation of Cuthbert to Durham in 1104, may indicate that Battiscombe's comment is correct and the list is simply a misnamed Durham list (or, rather, that it represents the whole collection of Durham relics). However, it is also possible that the list is in fact, meant to represent the 'original' Lindisfarnian relic collection, presumably a subset of the complete Durham collection. It will be of interest to see how it compares to the other Durham lists. Despite his sure comments that the Dijon material is an alternate recension for each D1 piece, it is very possible that Battiscombe never viewed the Dijon MS and only knew of it; his footnote seems to imply this may be the case.</p>
      <h3>General Manuscript Context Remarks</h3>
      <p>It is of interest that this list reappears in similar contexts: hagiographical material that represents the identity of Durham as a monastic house--that is, a home (if something of an ersatz one) for Cuthbert, Bede, and other very early Northumbrian saint and holy figures. Further assessment and comparison is bound to be fruitful here.

    <h2>Dating</h2>
    <p>Battiscombe suggests that this relic list was written up after the translation of Cuthbert in 1104 to Durham, but not later than the middle of the twelfth century. His dating is derived from a combination of the list's relationship to its textual relatives (that is, Y and D1.A*) and general palaeographic grounds.<br></p>
