    <h2>Manuscript</h2>
    <p>The manuscript from which this list was sourced is unknown, as neither Hutchins nor his editors make any reference to the source except to term it a 'very curious Latin manuscript' (Hutchins, 225). Due to the style of the remainder of Hutchins' history and the period in which it was written, one can hypothesize the manuscript to have been found locally at Wimbourne, or at the least within the county of Dorset. Equally troublesomely, this list has been provided only in Hutchins' English translation.</p>
    <h2>Dating</h2>
    <p>The date of this list has to be extrapolated from the given saints and the list style. S. Edmund, Thomas Beckett, and a  S. Francis (of Assisi?) all appear. Beckett is referred to as 'blessed' rather than 'saint'. There is also a shoe from 'St William of ...wich', probably S. William of Norwich, d. 1144, a child saint supposedly killed by Jews. Furthermore, a 'St Richard', perhaps Richard of Chichester, d. 1253, also appears. This evidence seems push for a dating of the latter quarter of the 13th century at the earliest, if one gives time for Richard's cult to pick up a bit after his death. The list itself, reflective of a somewhat modest collection, is also arranged according to litanic hierarchy, in that 'saints' come first (that is, Christ-relics and Marian relics), and then the groups of martyrs, confessors, and virgins follow, in that order. This style of arrangement is most common in lists of the 13th to 14th centuries; later lists tend to be more material-inventorial in character, making more reference to e.g., previous materials used in reliquaries themselves or their locations in, on, and around various altars. The fairly modest size of the collection also somewhat speaks in favour of this dating.</p>
