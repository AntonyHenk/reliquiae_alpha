    <h2>Manuscript</h2>
    <p>This relic list appears in Cambridge, Corpus Christi College MS 111, on p. 6, the verso of a leaf.<br><br> 
    MS 111 has picked up the nickname 'The Bath Cartulary', but it should be noted that the manuscript in toto is not precisely a cartulary, but rather a large miscellany containing quite a wide variety of material, much of it antiquarian in nature. A significant portion of it is in the hand of Robert Talbot, an antiquarian, like Parker and John Joscelyn, known for his interest in Old English materials. This manuscript is paginated on rectos and versos, thus reference to single leaves requires two page numbers. The leaf on which this text appears (pp. 5 and 6) was probably removed from a different Bath manuscript and bound in with the other material, but quite some time ago, as the the pagination runs as expected and, furthermore, the majority of the wormholes on both of these leaves match up neatly. The genre of book from which this leaf originated is difficult to ascertain, if it came from a book at all. The parchment is a low-quality piece from the edge of the skin, and a very large brown flaw takes up a large portion of the bottom, visible on both hair and flesh side. On the flesh side (p. 6, the side with the relic list), the finishing of the writing surface is poorly scraped, visibly 'fibrous' and wrinkled in some places, with three scrape-through or injury holes in the skin. The hair-side (p. 5) is quite stubbly and hairy. It is, in any case, not a leaf one selects for public display or artistic use. 
    <br><br>
    Another notable trait of the leaf is that it is not ruled, and the relic list's hand is not very calligraphic in appearance: high variability in the letterforms and writing with a nearly-dry pen suggest a hasty hand unconcerned with scribal beauty. This suggests that the leaf is a working document. Perhaps the most interesting feature is the faint annotation in the left margin. The first five letters appear to be 'Reliq', and the last two an 'i' and an ?abbreviatory? sign-- presumably meant as 'Reliquiae'. The 9-shaped 'q' concurs with script of the list itself. This word thus appears to be a marginal label or heading for list, which once again suggest some type of working document. Despite the fact that the list is running and not columnar, and bears no tick-marks, this list seem almost certainly inventorial in nature.<br><br>         
    
    To revisit a bit of information from the other manuscript context pages for the Bath lists, note that the movement of leaves is provably the case for the leaf just after this one (pp. 7 and 8), on which relic lists B1.A* and B1.B* appear, as well as another leaf in the manuscript (pp. 55 and 56).

    It should be noted that James' catalogue entry for MS 111 contains an extremely infelicitous error on p. 236: his diagram of a nonstandard quire with singletons inserted in it is mislabelled. This diagram is meant to show quire four, which contains five leaves. Quire four does indeed include a leaf from 'cent. xi.' as a singleton bound in as the fifth leaf. However, that singleton is not 'pp. 7, 8' as James' diagram states, but rather <em>'pp. 55, 56'</em>!
