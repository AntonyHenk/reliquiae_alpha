    <h2>Manuscript Context Notes coming soon!</h2>
<!--<h2>Manuscript</h2>
    <p>This relic list appears in several source manuscripts: <br>
      (1) It appears in Trinity College Cambridge MS O. 3. 55, f. 2r-v.<br> 
      (2) It appears in Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Digby 41, on the 'four leaves at the end of the manuscript', which are from an older MS (see below).<br> 
      (3) It appears in Dijon, Biblioth√©que publique, MS 657 (396), f. 39r. <br> 
      Furthermore, this list is also 'bodily incorporated in the York list'[i.e., LocaSanctorumTextID: Y]. Additionally, an extract of this list was copied into Cambridge University Library Ff. I. 27 on f. 194v of the red chalk foliation [i.e., LocaSanctorumTextID: D1.A*].<br><br>

      According to N. R. Ker, the four leaves at the end of Digby 41 actually belong to a <em>Life of St Cuthbert</em>, British Library, MS Harley 1924.
      (Battiscombe, <em>Relics of St Cuthbert</em> (1956), 113; Ker, <em>British Museum Quarterly</em> 12(1938): 133.)

    <h2>Dating</h2>
    <p>Battiscombe suggests that this list was written up after the translation of Cuthbert in 1104 to Durham, but not later than the middle of the twelfth century. His dating is derived from a combination of the list's relationship to its textual relatives (that is, Y and D1.A*)</p>
