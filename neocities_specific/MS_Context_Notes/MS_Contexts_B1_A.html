    <h2>Manuscript</h2>
    <p>This relic list appears in Cambridge, Corpus Christi College MS 111, on p. 7, the recto of a leaf.<br><br> 
    MS 111 has picked up the nickname 'The Bath Cartulary', but it should be noted that the manuscript in toto is not precisely a cartulary, but rather a large miscellany containing quite a wide variety of material, much of it antiquarian in nature. A significant portion of it is in the hand of Robert Talbot, an antiquarian, like Parker and John Joscelyn, known for his interest in Old English materials. This manuscript is paginated on rectos and versos, thus reference to single leaves requires two page numbers. The leaf on which this relic list appears (pp. 7 and 8), as well as another leaf in the manuscript (pp. 55 and 56) are noted by Neil Ker and M. R. James to have originally been a part of Cambridge, Corpus Christi College MS 140, The Bath Old English Gospels, and almost surely came from the same quire (Ker, 48-49; James, 236-237). MS 111 is notable for significant responsive reading and use activity. Someone, almost surely a 16th c. antiquarian in Parker's circle, used the 'Parkerian crayon' to annotate and underline many areas of the manuscript, particularly material having to do with the history of the English church. A reasonably large scribal sample of this crayoning hand can be found on p. 134. This user (presumably) also paginated the manuscript, including the inserted leaves from MS 140, and did so in a consecutive manner. Judging by collation of MS 111's contents against the appropriate entry in one of the available Parker Registers (e.g., Cambridge, Corpus Christi College MS 575, p. 109), it can be clearly seen that both leaves from MS 140 were already kept bound together with the material making up MS 111 by the time the Parker Registers were created. This fact suggests that the evulsed leaves were moved by Matthew Parker, someone in his immediate circle, or a prior user or owner.
    <br><br>
    It should be noted that James' catalogue entry for MS 111 contains an extremely infelicitous error on p. 236: his diagram of a nonstandard quire with singletons inserted in it is mislabelled. This diagram is meant to show quire four, which contains five leaves. Quire four does indeed include a leaf from 'cent. xi.' as a singleton bound in as the fifth leaf. However, that singleton is not 'pp. 7, 8' as James' diagram states, but rather <em>'pp. 55, 56'</em>!

    <h2>Dating</h2>
    <p>This relic list is one of three lists in MS 111. It has been dated to the eleventh century by James and more closely by Ker to the second half of the eleventh century.
