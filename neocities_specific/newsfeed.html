      <h2>Site Updates 03.09.2023</h2>
       <p>The index page's tooltips are still an ongoing issue in terms of looks, but they do work now. There are some tweaks I will make to the Relic List catalogue in a bit regarding the structuring of some entries (I think I may have a duplicate, and some entries need further disambiguation).  
        <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Relic List Catalogue: </b>Finished revamping the big catalogue and putting everything into 'Chicago-Lite'. I will make a full-form bibliography for that page at a later point. Also, 'Leominster' now comes before 'Lichfield', rather than being in order of LocaSanctorum indentifier.</li>
          <li><b>Manuscript Context Pages: </b>Fixed a minor aesthetic issue re: return nav buttons caused by missing /div tags.</li>
          <li><b>Index Page: </b>Tooltips now work, though they're not very attractive. I've also fixed the dividing line between these update entries, as you can see.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h2>Site Updates 30.08.2023</h2>
       <p>I'm still trying to get my tooltips functioning for the menu bar on the left of the index, but there's some kink I can't seem to work out, annoyingly. 
        <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Index Page: </b>As stated, still working on trying to get the tooltips to show up. No idea what's wrong, as they should work, as far as I know. I've also fixed a weird spacing issue caused by a mistake in setting the floats.</li>
        </ol>
   </p>
  </div>

    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 27.08.2023</h2>
       <p>I've decided to implement an update section on the Loca Sanctorum index page so that users will know which areas of the site they might want to check up on. If you're looking for up-to-date stuff, the best thing is to check the Progress Tracker, as I input information into that Google Sheet before I publish it in a tidy way on Loca Sanctorum. So, if you can decipher my note-taking, that's always your best bet. I do usually push out major updates about once a week, though--which from now on will be announced right here!  
        <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Relic List Catalogue: </b>Ongoing updating of this page; about 50 percent is done. New printed editions have added to Thorney, Reading, and a few other items. Bibliographical info is currently being normalised to a new standard based on current Chicago style. I am also slowly implementing manuscript context pages for the lists. This is done rather slowly and unevenly, as I do the ones that are the most important (i.e., the ones that really need explanatory notes) first.</li>
          <li><b>MS Context pages: </b>Ongoing, as stated. I work on these more or less as I bump into bibliography or feel the need to set down information for later reference. Milly, if you're reading this, your illustrated catalogue's been added to the bib for the MS Context pages for the Bath lists, and I'll of course reference the entry for CCCC MS 286 when I get that one up (but it will take a bit, since that one's going to be A Project&trade;).</li>
          <li><b>Correspondence Table: </b>Did you know that there's a correspondence table you can view? You can find the button to reach it from the Relic List Catalogue. (Okay actually, I'm kinda kidding. It's there, but it's not done yet... can't really make a correspondence until I'm dead sure of all the Loca Sanctorum IDs, which is ongoing work...)</li>
          <li><b>Index page: </b>Building the html framework for the Iframe and other materials, and adjusting the CSS so that this news feed is viewable as an inset, scrollable page on the index. I haven't gotten the tooltips to work on the menu bar to the right, so please bear with me on those. They will return soon enough!</li>
          <li><b>Secondary Bibliography page: </b>I recently did an HTML dump of selected Zotero entries in order to populate that page, but the entries are basically completely raw. I'm not planning to do much in the way of revisions at the moment as I am writing a funding application at the moment.</li>
