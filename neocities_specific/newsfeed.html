      <h2>Site Updates 07.10.2023 [redux!]</h2>
      <p>Mostly a few fixes for cosmetic things. Additionally, as I reviewed things, I realize I need to overhaul my textID system one more time to make it truly logically sound and consistent, as well as update the Correspondence tool again afterward. So, for the time being, <div style="display:inline; color: red;"><b><em>please do not rely on any sigla posted here for bibliographical reasons!!!!</em></b></div>   
      </p> 
      <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Index page: </b>Cosmetic tweaks.</li>
          <li><b>Manuscript Details page for D1α*, D1β*, D1γ*: </b>Couple of cosmetic tweaks.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Coming Attractions</h3>
        Before I do anything else, I will be updating the TextID system across the entire site. This will take a little bit of time because I have two catalogues to manually correct, and I also need to correct the XML of the editions themselves, plus the subindex they reside on. I will complete this work tomorrow and update the catalogues and other pages as needed.    
          </div>  
    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 07.10.2023</h2>
      <p>I have added a massive update to the manuscript details page for the group of Durham lists. If you know the name 'Bertram Colgrave' and like to look at handwritten autograph notes of the scholars of yesteryear, you'll really want to have a look.
      </p> 
      <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Relic List Catalogue: </b>Adjusted the way I was displaying the Durham-list-group.</li>
          <li><b>Catalogue of Relic Lists: Before 1300: </b>Adjusted the way I was displaying the Durham-list-group.</li>
          <li><b>Manuscript Details page for D1α*, D1β*, D1γ*: </b>Wrote up a huge entry on D1α*'s manuscript, added links to the online viewers of the MSS for the D1-Greek lists, added some more details to all the D1-greek lists.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Coming Attractions</h3>
          I am aware I need to adjust some of the titles and other details/elements of the few currently posted relic lists editions. I will do this soon. Additionally, I will be setting up a formal testing area on my site for my own use. It will not visible to end users, however, unless I decide to be silly and hide a secret link to it somewhere on the site. I am also still in the process of writing the section that defines and explains relic lists, at least in a preliminary manner, but I expect to have some good progress on this soon. I am still writing funding things at this time, but have made it more or less to the final leg of the first draft, so from this point I should be able to go back to working on the site a bit more.    
          </div>  

    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 04.10.2023</h2>
      <p>I have added new tabular catalogue that focuses on pre-1300 material and made a few other tweaks, particularly regarding IDs/sigla. The pre-1300 catalogue will likely be expanded to record more detailed information at a later point.</p> 
      <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Relic List Catalogue: </b>Now called the 'Catalogue of Relic Lists: All Lists'. Some minor adjustments made, including splitting some texts.</li>
          <li><b>Catalogue of Relic Lists: Before 1300: </b>Page created and put online.</li>
          <li><b>Index: </b>Minor adjustments, new buttons.
          <li><b>Correspondence Table: </b>Some edits to more clearly explain how to read textual IDs.</li>
          </ol>
          </div>  
          
    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 03.09.2023</h2>
       <p>The index page's tooltips are still an ongoing issue in terms of looks, but they do work now. There are some tweaks I will make to the Relic List catalogue in a bit regarding the structuring of some entries (I think I may have a duplicate, and some entries need further disambiguation).  
        <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Relic List Catalogue: </b>Finished revamping the big catalogue and putting everything into 'Chicago-Lite'. I will make a full-form bibliography for that page at a later point. Also, 'Leominster' now comes before 'Lichfield', rather than being in order of LocaSanctorum indentifier.</li>
          <li><b>Manuscript Context Pages: </b>Fixed a minor aesthetic issue re: return nav buttons caused by missing /div tags.</li>
          <li><b>Index Page: </b>Tooltips now work, though they're not very attractive. I've also fixed the dividing line between these update entries, as you can see.</li>
          <li><b>Secondary Bibliography: </b>Added a couple of important sources and fixed authorship on another source cause by a Zotero problem.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Coming Attractions</h3>
        My next plans revolve around (1) splitting some lists into several lists according to my own ID system, which breaks the texts down a bit differently than Thomas did, (2) completing a few more of the MS context pages that I have set up so far, and (3) finishing a couple of explanatory articles that I have been drafting which explain a little bit about the history of Christian relic veneration and discuss relic lists and inventories themselves. I am currently still writing a funding application, so I am unable to devote too much time to housekeeping, but these things already in motion more or less.

      <h2>Site Updates 30.08.2023</h2>
       <p>I'm still trying to get my tooltips functioning for the menu bar on the left of the index, but there's some kink I can't seem to work out, annoyingly. 
        <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Index Page: </b>As stated, still working on trying to get the tooltips to show up. No idea what's wrong, as they should work, as far as I know. I've also fixed a weird spacing issue caused by a mistake in setting the floats.</li>
        </ol>
   </p>

    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 27.08.2023</h2>
       <p>I've decided to implement an update section on the Loca Sanctorum index page so that users will know which areas of the site they might want to check up on. If you're looking for up-to-date stuff, the best thing is to check the Progress Tracker, as I input information into that Google Sheet before I publish it in a tidy way on Loca Sanctorum. So, if you can decipher my note-taking, that's always your best bet. I do usually push out major updates about once a week, though--which from now on will be announced right here!  
        <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Relic List Catalogue: </b>Ongoing updating of this page; about 50 percent is done. New printed editions have added to Thorney, Reading, and a few other items. Bibliographical info is currently being normalised to a new standard based on current Chicago style. I am also slowly implementing manuscript context pages for the lists. This is done rather slowly and unevenly, as I do the ones that are the most important (i.e., the ones that really need explanatory notes) first.</li>
          <li><b>MS Context pages: </b>Ongoing, as stated. I work on these more or less as I bump into bibliography or feel the need to set down information for later reference. Milly, if you're reading this, your illustrated catalogue's been added to the bib for the MS Context pages for the Bath lists, and I'll of course reference the entry for CCCC MS 286 when I get that one up (but it will take a bit, since that one's going to be A Project&trade;).</li>
          <li><b>Correspondence Table: </b>Did you know that there's a correspondence table you can view? You can find the button to reach it from the Relic List Catalogue. (Okay actually, I'm kinda kidding. It's there, but it's not done yet... can't really make a correspondence until I'm dead sure of all the Loca Sanctorum IDs, which is ongoing work...)</li>
          <li><b>Index page: </b>Building the html framework for the Iframe and other materials, and adjusting the CSS so that this news feed is viewable as an inset, scrollable page on the index. I haven't gotten the tooltips to work on the menu bar to the right, so please bear with me on those. They will return soon enough!</li>
          <li><b>Secondary Bibliography page: </b>I recently did an HTML dump of selected Zotero entries in order to populate that page, but the entries are basically completely raw. I'm not planning to do much in the way of revisions at the moment as I am writing a funding application at the moment.</li>
