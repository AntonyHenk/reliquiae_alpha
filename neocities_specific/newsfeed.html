      <p>I have added a new page to describe and show the future plans for this project, including mockup of the interface and discussion of the XML markup itself. This was pretty desperately needed!</p>

      <p>Added further shelfmarks and loca to a couple of items.</p>
      <h3>Coming Attractions</h3>
      <p>See below for planned fixes: mostly further bibliographical cleanup, setting up a couple of explanatory pages (e.g., 'what is a relic list'), and adding a Thomas correspondence column on the big catalogue. Some things are still moving a bit slowly because of the British Library outage.

      <h2>Site Updates 05.11.2023</h2>
      <p>I've made a few changes to incorporate some choices in shaping the corpus, dealt with some housekeeping issues, and resolved a couple of small problems.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Corpus Changes: I have eliminated a couple of things from the catalogue because they are not really definable as relic lists. These can still be found, however, on the new 'Relic List-Adjacent Texts' page.</li>
        <li>Relic List-Adjacent Texts: This page displays the lists that have been retired from the corpus but are considered by others, such as in I.G. Thomas' dissertation. It also displays information on e.g., resting place lists. Later I will also add bibliography for kalendars, litanies, the Menologium, martyrologies, and so on.</li>
        <li>Housekeeping: I have replaced Greek characters with UTF-8 HTML entities. Hopefully there should be no more issues with Greek characters displaying as a tofu/box. I also changed the URL for the to-1300 catalogue slightly.</li>
        <li><b>FOUND A MANUSCRIPT</b>: The manuscript shelfmark and repository has been found for the Leominster list, in the register of Hereford bishop Richard de Swinfield. I have made sitewide updates to reflect this. My thanks to J. Richardson for his dissertation, which was most helpful in this matter and is a useful aid to interpreting the list.</li>
        <li>Citation style: On the manuscript notes pages, I am shifting to using an author-date style. I have updated the in-text parenthetical citations, more or less, and will update the mini-bibliographies on the bottoms of the notes pages later on.</li>
        <li><b>DATE CORRECTION</b>: The Thetford list had been dated a century off based on faulty information in Thomas (an infelicitous typo), but I have since corrected this. I have added a manuscript note page for the Thetford list with some explanation.</li> 
      </ol>

    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 22.10.2023</h2>
      <p>I've completed some overhauling on the relic list tabular catalogues and retired the old pre-1300 catalogue. The notes on the manuscripts are now accessible by clicking a little icon set up in its own column, and the pre-1300 catalogue now makes use of dropdowns for the short descriptions. The old 'Correspondence' is now an explanatory page, which I think is a bit more elegant. The overall catalogue has had some of its entries condensed and others expanded. Wording on several of the short descriptions has been made more exact, especially in terms gospel types. All the has been done directly in the code editor, so in some places I will need to once more replace dumb quotes with smart ones, etc., but that can wait.</p>      

      <h3>Coming Attractions</h3>
        <p>
        More tidying to be done around here with respect to manuscript loca and citations of relic list editions, some of which really need a 'page-page, at page-page' statement added to them. As usual, my energies are devoted first and foremost to the early materials for now. I plan to experiment with a lay-audience friendly page that explains what relic lists are and uses an iframe to display a manuscript on the same page, but that's for a later date. The big catalogue also needs the Thomas sigla correspondence column added to it, which I will handle a little later.<br><br> 
        I know I also need to adjust the way I have styled this Iframe that display the newsfeed scroll, as well. I am currently still very busy with drafting things related to funding, so some of the more fun aspects aspects of the site will have to wait a little longer...
        </p> 
        </div>  
    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 15.10.2023</h2>
      <p>msIDs D5 and D6 have been switched around, such that D5_1.A now refers to the list in Cambridge, Cambridge University Library MS Ff. I. 27, on p. 194, and D6_3 refers to the 'Liber de Reliquiis' in Durham Cathedral MS B.II.35, ff. 192râ€“198v. I have also reworded some things in the explanatory bit at the top.</p>      

      <h3>Coming Attractions</h3>
        <p>The pre-1300 catalogue is being overhauled a final time, after I realized it really needed a different format than the complete catalogue. The new format for the pre-1300 lists eliminates the need for reference to a separate correspondence table, as it includes the Thomas sigla already on it and displays some information in a more compact format.</p> 
        </div>  
    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 13.10.2023</h2>
      <p>I've completed a mass overhaul of listID standards across the whole site and in all XML editions. I have also fixed a couple of broken links caused by file renaming and updated the correspondence table page to be more descriptive of methodology for listIDs.</p>      

      <h3>Coming Attractions</h3>
        <p>I will slowly begin adding more information to MS context pages a little at a time, as well as crosslinking them to one another. It is also possible that I will split the massive context page for the Durham lists into three context pages and disambiguate their entries in the tables; additionally it is possible that I will group the Tw1_1 lists together into a single heading. I still have to think about my best options on that one, but for now this will stay as they are.</p> 
        </div>  
    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 09.10.2023</h2>
      <p>The id system for texts and manuscripts is still being overhauled in some places on the site, but I have completed the biggest parts of it.    
      </p> 
      <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Catalogue of All Lists: </b>Everything is now converted to the listID system. Some terminology changed to resolve this. Links to MS context pages also fixed up again.</li>
          <li><b>Catalogue of Lists to 1300: </b>Everything is now converted to the listID system. Some terminology changed to resolve this. Links to MS context pages also fixed up again.</li>
          <li><b>Manuscript Details pages: </b>All of these have had any references to listIDs updated to new standard, links also updated as needed.</li>
          <li><b>Correspondence Table page: </b>Updated to reflect new listID standard.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Coming Attractions</h3>
        <p>I have yet to finish updating the XML alpha editions to the new listID standard, but this will be should be done soon. For now I am leaving the old lists up, as when I update these I also have to update a lot of file names and links in the catalogues, as well as the subdirectory for the relic lists.</p>      
        </div>  
    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 07.10.2023 [redux!]</h2>
      <p>Mostly a few fixes for cosmetic things. Additionally, as I reviewed things, I realize I need to overhaul my textID system one more time to make it truly logically sound and consistent, as well as update the Correspondence tool again afterward. So, for the time being, <div style="display:inline; color: red;"><b><em>please do not rely on any sigla posted here for bibliographical reasons!!!!</em></b></div>   
      </p> 
      <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Index page: </b>Cosmetic tweaks.</li>
          <li><b>Manuscript Details page for D1Î±*, D1Î²*, D1Î³*: </b>Couple of cosmetic tweaks.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Coming Attractions</h3>
        <p>Before I do anything else, I will be updating the TextID system across the entire site. This will take a little bit of time because I have two catalogues to manually correct, and I also need to correct the XML of the editions themselves, plus the subindex they reside on. I will complete this work tomorrow and update the catalogues and other pages as needed.</p>    
          </div>  
    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 07.10.2023</h2>
      <p>I have added a massive update to the manuscript details page for the group of Durham lists. If you know the name 'Bertram Colgrave' and like to look at handwritten autograph notes of the scholars of yesteryear, you'll really want to have a look.
      </p> 
      <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Relic List Catalogue: </b>Adjusted the way I was displaying the Durham-list-group.</li>
          <li><b>Catalogue of Relic Lists: Before 1300: </b>Adjusted the way I was displaying the Durham-list-group.</li>
          <li><b>Manuscript Details page for D1Î±*, D1Î²*, D1Î³*: </b>Wrote up a huge entry on D1Î±*'s manuscript, added links to the online viewers of the MSS for the D1-Greek lists, added some more details to all the D1-greek lists.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Coming Attractions</h3>
          <p>I am aware I need to adjust some of the titles and other details/elements of the few currently posted relic lists editions. I will do this soon. Additionally, I will be setting up a formal testing area on my site for my own use. It will not visible to end users, however, unless I decide to be silly and hide a secret link to it somewhere on the site. I am also still in the process of writing the section that defines and explains relic lists, at least in a preliminary manner, but I expect to have some good progress on this soon. I am still writing funding things at this time, but have made it more or less to the final leg of the first draft, so from this point I should be able to go back to working on the site a bit more.</p>    
          </div>  

    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 04.10.2023</h2>
      <p>I have added new tabular catalogue that focuses on pre-1300 material and made a few other tweaks, particularly regarding IDs/sigla. The pre-1300 catalogue will likely be expanded to record more detailed information at a later point.</p> 
      <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Relic List Catalogue: </b>Now called the 'Catalogue of Relic Lists: All Lists'. Some minor adjustments made, including splitting some texts.</li>
          <li><b>Catalogue of Relic Lists: Before 1300: </b>Page created and put online.</li>
          <li><b>Index: </b>Minor adjustments, new buttons.
          <li><b>Correspondence Table: </b>Some edits to more clearly explain how to read textual IDs.</li>
          </ol>
          </div>  
          
    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 03.09.2023</h2>
       <p>The index page's tooltips are still an ongoing issue in terms of looks, but they do work now. There are some tweaks I will make to the Relic List catalogue in a bit regarding the structuring of some entries (I think I may have a duplicate, and some entries need further disambiguation).  
        <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Relic List Catalogue: </b>Finished revamping the big catalogue and putting everything into 'Chicago-Lite'. I will make a full-form bibliography for that page at a later point. Also, 'Leominster' now comes before 'Lichfield', rather than being in order of LocaSanctorum indentifier.</li>
          <li><b>Manuscript Context Pages: </b>Fixed a minor aesthetic issue re: return nav buttons caused by missing /div tags.</li>
          <li><b>Index Page: </b>Tooltips now work, though they're not very attractive. I've also fixed the dividing line between these update entries, as you can see.</li>
          <li><b>Secondary Bibliography: </b>Added a couple of important sources and fixed authorship on another source cause by a Zotero problem.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Coming Attractions</h3>
        My next plans revolve around (1) splitting some lists into several lists according to my own ID system, which breaks the texts down a bit differently than Thomas did, (2) completing a few more of the MS context pages that I have set up so far, and (3) finishing a couple of explanatory articles that I have been drafting which explain a little bit about the history of Christian relic veneration and discuss relic lists and inventories themselves. I am currently still writing a funding application, so I am unable to devote too much time to housekeeping, but these things already in motion more or less.     
      </div>

    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 30.08.2023</h2>
       <p>I'm still trying to get my tooltips functioning for the menu bar on the left of the index, but there's some kink I can't seem to work out, annoyingly. 
        <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Index Page: </b>As stated, still working on trying to get the tooltips to show up. No idea what's wrong, as they should work, as far as I know. I've also fixed a weird spacing issue caused by a mistake in setting the floats.</li>
        </ol>
   </p>
  </div>

    <div style="display:block; border-bottom: 2px dotted maroon;">
      <h2>Site Updates 27.08.2023</h2>
       <p>I've decided to implement an update section on the Loca Sanctorum index page so that users will know which areas of the site they might want to check up on. If you're looking for up-to-date stuff, the best thing is to check the Progress Tracker, as I input information into that Google Sheet before I publish it in a tidy way on Loca Sanctorum. So, if you can decipher my note-taking, that's always your best bet. I do usually push out major updates about once a week, though--which from now on will be announced right here!  
        <h3>Update List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Relic List Catalogue: </b>Ongoing updating of this page; about 50 percent is done. New printed editions have added to Thorney, Reading, and a few other items. Bibliographical info is currently being normalised to a new standard based on current Chicago style. I am also slowly implementing manuscript context pages for the lists. This is done rather slowly and unevenly, as I do the ones that are the most important (i.e., the ones that really need explanatory notes) first.</li>
          <li><b>MS Context pages: </b>Ongoing, as stated. I work on these more or less as I bump into bibliography or feel the need to set down information for later reference. Milly, if you're reading this, your illustrated catalogue's been added to the bib for the MS Context pages for the Bath lists, and I'll of course reference the entry for CCCC MS 286 when I get that one up (but it will take a bit, since that one's going to be A Project&trade;).</li>
          <li><b>Correspondence Table: </b>Did you know that there's a correspondence table you can view? You can find the button to reach it from the Relic List Catalogue. (Okay actually, I'm kinda kidding. It's there, but it's not done yet... can't really make a correspondence until I'm dead sure of all the Loca Sanctorum IDs, which is ongoing work...)</li>
          <li><b>Index page: </b>Building the html framework for the Iframe and other materials, and adjusting the CSS so that this news feed is viewable as an inset, scrollable page on the index. I haven't gotten the tooltips to work on the menu bar to the right, so please bear with me on those. They will return soon enough!</li>
          <li><b>Secondary Bibliography page: </b>I recently did an HTML dump of selected Zotero entries in order to populate that page, but the entries are basically completely raw. I'm not planning to do much in the way of revisions at the moment as I am writing a funding application at the moment.</li>
