    <!-- This is shaping up to be a replacement for the original tabcat for the pre 1300s lists. Should I make some of the things tooltipped or just jam it all onto the page? I should definitely add the links to the MS context files and links out to the MSS though, alongside the direct links to the XML editions
    DONT FORGET TO ADD THE FOLIO NUMBERS!"!!!!"-->

    <h1>Correspondence Table for Lists Before 1300 [Under Construction!]</h1>
    <a class="navbutton" href="index.html">Return to Index</a>
    <p>This correspondence table is updated often, but the most recent versions will always be located on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iguUwVL0wUUrndFCb4fPLAMHnDjlfiax5XvupK6Uq0s/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">Progress Tracker</a>. Click the tab 'Correspondence' to see the table, which is drawn from the master data and updates every time the master data is changed.<br>
  <p>This area provides a simple correspondence table between witness manuscripts' msIDs (the first part of the listID before the underscore), complete listIDs for any lists <em>witnessed in that manuscript</em>, I. G. Thomas' sigla, witness manuscripts' shelfmarks, and name/locale of religious houses associated. This table shows only lists which predate ca. 1300. The system here operating instead of sigla uses 'msIDs' and 'textIDs', which when combined form a 'listID'. This system is meant to account for the challenges of editing this type of text. A brief summary of convetions is given below, but for more details on this system, see <a href="interpreting_listIDs.html">Interpreting ListIDs</a>.<!--This is the spot to link the old correspondence page copy. Also I should here mention how to view everything else.-->
    <ul>
      <li>If a relic list is known to have once contained in a different manuscript due to movement of leaves, the prior container-MS is indicated after a slash and within parentheses thus: Cambridge, Corpus Christi College MS 111 / (Cambridge, Corpus Christi College MS 140).</li>
      <li>If a manuscript's name has changed in recent years, legacy shelfmark(s) are given, introduced by <i>olim</i>.</li>
      <li>Nicknames of manuscripts are only given when the manuscript's shelfmark has changed in recent years, as the nickname is intended as an extra finding aid. Nicknames are given in single quotes.</li>
      <li>An asterisk (*) in the msID indicates that this relic list is either (a) only extant today in a printed edition or (b) in a manuscript that cannot be located at this point because, e.g., an editor did not cite it. Some items may be designated with an asterisk temporarily.
      </li>
      <li>At times a plus sign (+) or the letter x (x) may appear in the listID system. This usually indicates that something about the list is troublesome, or that as of yet the project has not progressed enough to decide how to break that list into various texts or assign the relevant manuscripts their msIDs.</li>
